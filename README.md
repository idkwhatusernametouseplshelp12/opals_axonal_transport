**Investigating Axonal Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease: A Live Cell Imaging Approach**

*Description*
Our project focuses on investigating the impact of Alzheimer's disease on axonal transport using advanced live-cell imaging techniques. This is done by developing a MATLAB code that aims to read videos that showcase various axonal transport proteins moving along telomeres in the axon. The code then calculates the average speed of these proteins and outputs it. This allows for a comparison between the average speed of wild-type, or normal neuron cells
